# M1_Marksheet_Generator_System_Uti

## Abstract
Today, there are lots of College and School is present, and it is increasing each day. So, it is become difficult to check the exam copies of each student correctly within the prescribed time. To overcome this problem, we are going to build a Mark sheet generation system which will check the answer copies of the student and also generate the mark card of each student. By use of this system a University, Colleges, and School will get the benefit and can produce the result of students with minimal error and in minimum time.

## Proposed system
Automation of mark sheet generation will reduce the time to create the marks card of the student. Also it is password protected system. The University only needs to upload the exam copies to the system and then the system will complete rest of the work. This application can check all the papers and can produce the result. The computers are much faster than the human, and hence it will take less time to produce the result. The University management can also change the procedure to produce the result if they want. The automation of mark sheet generation system will not only reduce the time but it will also reduce the cost as the number of the person require is less.
